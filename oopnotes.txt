A class is a namegroup of properties and functions

A class is a template of an object,
An object is an instance of a class
class -> object(s)
Class can be a data type

class -> logical construct
object -> physical reality, occupies space in memory

Instance Variables - The variables inside the object
The '.' operator links reference variable with instance variable
eg, student1.rollno (reference variable. instance variable)
'new' keyword does dynamic memory allocation
We have Complie time = Run time
eg Student student1 = new Student();
java is a static type language
Construcyor is a special type of function inside a class
When a new object is being created, it goes inside constructor 

We can call a constructor from another constructor
use this(a,b,c,.....,n) here a, b,...,n are the argument values of the other constructor

In java, primitive datatypes are stored in stack only, hence we don't use new keyword for them
For those with new keyword, they are the objects stored in heap memory

We can create datatypes using num with the help of wrapper classes
eg -> Integer num = new Integer(45)

Using 'final' keyword, we can prevent our content to be modified
convention-> final int INCREASE (all caps) = 2;
final variables have to be initialised always while declaring it

In objects we can change the value of object but not reassign the object value with final keyword
In primitive datatypes, we can't do neither
