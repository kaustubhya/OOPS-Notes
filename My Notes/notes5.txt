Sometimes the parent class just gives us a generalised form of the function, and it leaves the body of the function empty for the child class,

Such a class determines the nature of the methods that the subclass must implement.

These are known as 'Abstract (Empty Parent)  Methods'.

eg. abstract void career (String name) 

These are also sometimes called: "Child class' responsibility".
Child Class must override the parent class.

Any class which has one or more abstract methods should be declared as an "Abstract Class".

eg. 
public abstract class Parent {
    abstract void career(String name);
}

We cannot create objects of an abstract class. We need to override them.

We also cannot create abstract constructors.
